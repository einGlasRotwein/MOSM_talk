Primer on **reproducible manuscripts** at the Mannheim Open Science Meetup on 27th March 2020, 5:30 pm (GMT +02:00).

## Mannheim Open Science Meetup
The Mannheim Open Science Meetup is a grassroots initiative that brings together Mannheim-based academics from diverse backgrounds with a shared interest in transparent, reliable research.
Scholars from all scientific disciplines are welcome, both experts and Open Science novices.
Find them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MAOpenScience) or look at the slides from previous meetings at the [OSF](https://osf.io/gzf9h/).

## Reproducible Manuscripts
Reliable research involves sharing your analyses and your manuscript in a way that others can reproduce it.
But how can you achieve that?
I will showcase how to write up reproducible manuscripts with R Markdown.
Sounds complicated and like a lot of work?
Donâ€™t worry: We will also discuss how it will save you time and effort when writing your manuscript and how you can implement things like collaborative writing and citation management.

## Online Meetup
Due to the Corona situation, we will hold this Meetup online.
This will make it harder to maintain the informal get-together we have had at the end of each meeting.
On the other side, a virtual meeting might make it easier to integrate the Meetup into our daily lives and facilitate attendance for colleagues beyond Mannheim.

## Code Capsule
If you found this repository, you already found the `.Rmd` that renders the whole presentation.
However, if you don't want to install all the packages needed to render the presentation, click the binder button at the top of this README.
It will open RStudio in your browser, without the need to install anything.
If you want, you can open `00reproducible_manuscripts.Rmd` in the Files pane on the bottom right corner and then click the little "Knit" button (the icon is a blue ball of yarn) that then appears in the menu bar above the file.
Thank you [Philipp Zumstein](https://github.com/zuphilip) for setting up the whole binder thingy!
