Primer on **reproducible manuscripts** at the Mannheim Open Science Meetup on 27th March 2020. You can find a YouTube video of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3fmbdkChz8).

## Mannheim Open Science Meetup
The Mannheim Open Science Meetup is a grassroots initiative that brings together Mannheim-based academics from diverse backgrounds with a shared interest in transparent, reliable research.
Scholars from all scientific disciplines are welcome, both experts and Open Science novices.
Find them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MAOpenScience) or look at the slides from previous meetings at the [OSF](https://osf.io/gzf9h/).

## Reproducible Manuscripts
Reliable research involves sharing your analyses and your manuscript in a way that others can reproduce it.
But how can you achieve that?
I will showcase how to write up reproducible manuscripts with R Markdown.
Sounds complicated and like a lot of work?
Donâ€™t worry: We will also discuss how it will save you time and effort when writing your manuscript and how you can implement things like collaborative writing and citation management.

## Code Capsules
If you found this repository, you already found the `.Rmd` that renders the whole presentation.
However, if you don't want to install all the packages needed to render the presentation, you have two options.

## binder
Click the binder button at the top of this README.
It will open RStudio in your browser, without the need to install anything.
If you want, you can open `00reproducible_manuscripts.Rmd` in the Files pane on the bottom right corner and then click the little "Knit" button (the icon is a blue ball of yarn) that then appears in the menu bar above the file.
Thank you [Philipp Zumstein](https://github.com/zuphilip) for setting up the whole binder thingy!

## CodeOcean
Likewise, you can find the code capsule of this talk on [CodeOcean](https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.3923848.v2). Again, you can run the capsule in your browser - if you want to, you can launch an RStudio environment. You can also just inspect the output of the last run (i.e. the PDF).
