Primer on **reproducible manuscripts** at the Mannheim Open Science Meetup on 27th March 2020, 5:30 pm (GMT +02:00).

## Mannheim Open Science Meetup
The Mannheim Open Science Meetup is a grassroots initiative that brings together Mannheim-based academics from diverse backgrounds with a shared interest in transparent, reliable research.
Scholars from all scientific disciplines are welcome, both experts and Open Science novices.
Find them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MAOpenScience) or look at the slides from previous meetings at the [OSF](https://osf.io/gzf9h/).

## Reproducible Manuscripts
Reliable research involves sharing your analyses and your manuscript in a way that others can reproduce it.
But how can you achieve that?
I will showcase how to write up reproducible manuscripts with R Markdown.
Sounds complicated and like a lot of work?
Donâ€™t worry: We will also discuss how it will save you time and effort when writing your manuscript and how you can implement things like collaborative writing and citation management.

## Online Meetup
Due to the Corona situation, we will hold this Meetup online.
This will make it harder to maintain the informal get-together we have had at the end of each meeting.
On the other side, a virtual meeting might make it easier to integrate the Meetup into our daily lives and facilitate attendance for colleagues beyond Mannheim.
